# Learn Design Patterns

A repository contains practice code of design patterns that I've learned.

This repository basically follows contents from \<Head First Design Patterns\> published by O'Reilly, but I've also refered [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com) and [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/).

## Programming languages used in implementations
* C#
* Java
* Python

### Future plans
* C++
* Ruby
* Go
* Rust

## Contents
1. Strategy pattern
2. Observer pattern
3. Decorator pattern

## What's next to learn?
the **Refactoring**. I've really eagered to learn it to refactor my hobby project, music-library aka Mulib.
