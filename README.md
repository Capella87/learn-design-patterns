# Learn Design Patterns

A repository contains practice code of design patterns that I've learned.

This repository basically follows contents from \<Head First Design Patterns\> published by O'Reilly, but I've also refered [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com) and [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/).

## Programming languages used in implementations

* C#
* Python
* C++
* Go

### Future plans

* JavaScript / TypeScript
* Lua
* Racket
* Rust
* Zig

### Miscellaneous

* D2 (for diagrams to describe)

## Contents

1. Strategy pattern
2. Observer pattern
3. Decorator pattern
4. Factory method
5. Singleton pattern

## What's next to learn?

the **Refactoring**. I've really eagered to learn it to refactor my hobby project, music-library aka Mulib.
